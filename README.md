# -Web-page-template
This is my first code uploaded to GitHub
At present, I don't know much about the uploading mechanism of GitHub
Welcome to correct (please understand)
The reason for writing this project is that my friend is building a website
So I began to learn how to design Web UI
But what I want to tell you is that I have only learned web design for two days
Maybe the technology is not mature yet, and the code written has many bugs
Let me say it again: the web page I designed may have many bugs. Please test it before using it. Finally, I sincerely thank you for choosing what I designed. Thank you
